            <p>‘You know the golden rule of tea drinking is very simple, the smaller the pot, the better the tea. So you see here is a very small purple sand clay pot. I got this in Yixing which is a historic city in the Yangtze River basin long famous for its ceramics.’You say while carefully place some tea leaves in the Cha Hu.</p>
            <p>‘Yes, this is fantastic. But wait, it seems no glaze on it.’ Alice reply.</p>
