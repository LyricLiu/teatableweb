I went to a village which is famous for Puer to get some best tea. For I helped farmers select and pinch off tea leaves, they brought me to their house to experience the process of tea make. And it was then, an antique kettle caught my eye. And I bought it from farmer's hand. He told me his father left this kettle for him.' you said.</p>
