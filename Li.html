            <p>‘Speak of my journey, I have a gift for you’ Mr. Li said ‘I encounter a very kind tea farmer in a small village on my way. Oh, not a farmer, we should call him tea artist. He lived on the hill and he produces the best oolong in the area there. His tea carries an intense orchid scent. You know why? He neighbored plants with tea! He is a genius in coaxing completely different tastes and aromas!’</p>

            <p>'Oops, it's boiling now' you get the kettle out of heating stove quickly, and decide to pour boiling water into Cha Hu.</p>
            <p>'Wait, wait!' Mr.Li stop you once again,'you cannot brew tea with boiling water.' He proceed ‘excessively hot water will cause the tea to release objectionable flavors. The ideal water temperature is when the water about to boil. I assume it might be 85-90℃.’</p>
